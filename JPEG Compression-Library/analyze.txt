When comparing JPEG compression results across different quality levels, we can see a clear trade-off between the file size reduction
and image quality. At a lower quality for example 20, compression is very big. The files shrink by over 
97–98%, with compression ratios as small as 0.016–0.046. This  means that the compressed files occupy less
than 5% of the original bit size. However, this comes at the cost of higher distortion. The Mean Squared Error (MSE)
values range from about 36-185, and PSNR drops to the 25–32 dB range, which shows that there is a visible degradation when it comes to the image quality.
In contrast, at quality = 100, images preserve far more detail—the MSE drops dramatically (as low as 0.09 for “boats.bmp”),
and PSNR climbs above 35 dB, with one image reaching an excellent 58 dB, signifying near-lossless reconstruction.
The trade-off is a larger file: compression ratios rise to roughly 0.26–0.57, meaning files retain 25–57%
of their original size. Overall, the results show that higher JPEG quality levels sharply improve
visual accuracy (lower MSE, higher PSNR) but reduce compression efficiency.
Quality = 20 prioritizes storage savings, while quality = 100 maintains image integrity suitable for analysis or archival use.
